## Neovim and Kitty configurations

This repo contains my current MacOS configurations. I am using kitty with lazyvim. Old Neovim setup is still in use on Windows, I'll upload that to a separate branch later.

### Installation Notes

* Cloning this repo's contents into `~/.config/` after installing kitty should work. Check with vim that lazy can install all the necessary packages.
* Themes excluded but currently using `tokyonight` for both kitty and nvim
* Window management between kitty and neovim might not work out of the box, check configurations and lazy package manager.
